**Title:** Number Guessing Game

**Description:**

This is a simple and engaging number guessing game implemented using JavaScript and the Inquirer.js library. It challenges users to correctly guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 6.

**Features:**

- Random number generation: The computer secretly generates a number within the specified range.
- User input: The user is prompted to enter their guess through an interactive command-line interface.
- Result comparison: The program compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback.
- Clear messages: Informative messages guide the user throughout the guessing experience.
